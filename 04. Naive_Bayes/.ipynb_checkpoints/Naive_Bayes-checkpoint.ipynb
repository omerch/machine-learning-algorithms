    "Naive Bayes is a family of probabilistic algorithms that use Probability Theory and Bayes Theorms to predict the category of the sample (piece of news and customer reviews). They are probabilistic which means they calculate each category of the sample and output the highest one. They way they get these probabilities is by using Bayes Theorm, which descirbe the probability of a feature, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to that feature. "

In our case, each word is treated as a feature and there are thousands of different words. Also, it performs well even with the presence of irrelevant features and is relatively unaffected by them. The other major advantage it has is its relative simplicity. Naive Bayes' works well right out of the box and tuning it's parameters is rarely ever necessary, except usually in cases where the distribution of the data is known. It rarely ever overfits the data. Another important advantage is that its model training and prediction times are very fast for the amount of data it can handle.
